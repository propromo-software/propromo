## The Project

### Why?

#### Introduction - Initial Situation

As a customer, I want to know how far along the project I commissioned has progressed. As a seller, I want to fulfill this request with minimal effort.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Example: Client**  
> I commissioned a project and haven't heard anything about it for two months
> Therefore, I write an email to arrange a meeting.

#### Problem and Target Audience

At some point, as a client, the whole process becomes too frustrating, both in terms of cost and time. The contractor (freelancer, student, small to medium-sized agile software company) then invites me into the internal SCRUM system. This costs them more time because they need to grant me different permissions and possibly repeatedly invite an employee from my company who also needs access. Additionally, every SCRUM system is more complex than the next, and I have no desire to familiarize myself with new software.

> [!TIP]
> Limited insight into a project often leads to dissatisfaction on the part of the
> client and/or the contractor.

### How?

#### Solution - What Propromo Does

> Propromo consolidates all common SCRUM systems into a single UI.

-   When clients can see what they are getting, they are willing to pay more for it.
-   The customer has free access to the project status, and no additional meetings are necessary. This saves both time and money.
-   The quality of the project can be improved since the customer has direct access to the team's SCRUM master.
-   ONLY the SCRUM master communicates with the client, allowing other team members to focus on their specific tasks.
