## Planned Value (PV)

The PV is the budgeted value intended for the work planned up to the current point in time. It represents the planned budget that should be utilized based on the schedule at the present time.

## Earned Value (EV)

The EV indicates how much budget the work completed to date represents. This value is determined by multiplying the percentage of completed work by the total budget. The EV helps to quantify the actual project progress.

## Actual Cost (AC)

The AC represents the actual costs incurred up to the current point in time for the work performed.
