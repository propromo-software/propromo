## Creating a monitor is easy.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="OpenSource">
    <Card title="Creating a monitor is easy!">
      1. Copy your project url.
      2. Visit [create-monitor](https://propromo.duckdns.org/create-monitor).
    </Card>

    ## 1. Copy the project url

    Go to the project dashboard, you want to display, and copy it's url.
    The url has the following format:
    [https://-_your-organization-name-_.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/-_your-project-name_-/boards/1](https://-_your-organization-name-_.atlassian.net/jira/your-work)

    > The board number doesn't matter, propromo does only fetch the basic data, not the board information.

    ## 2. Visit create-monitor

    Visit [create-monitor](https://propromo.duckdns.org/create-monitor) and paste the url in the input field.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="PrivateDomain">

    <Card title="Creating a monitor is easy!">
      1. Create a new github pat token.
      2. Copy your project url.
      3. Visit [create-monitor](https://propromo.duckdns.org/create-monitor).
    </Card>

    ## 1. Create a new github pat token

    If you want to create a monitor and the project you want to display is private,
    you need a Github pat token with read scopes first.

    You can create such token at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
    These are the needed scopes you need to select (_read-only_ needed, no write access):

    <PhotoSwipe imageFolder="create-monitor" />

    > Note: If the project is public, you just need the url of the project.

    ## 2. Copy the project url

    Go to the project dashboard, you want to display, and copy it's url.
    The url has the following format:
    [https://github.com/-_users or orgs_\-/\-_login-name_\-/projects/\-_id_\-/views/\-_id_\-](https://github.com/orgs/propromo-software/projects/1/views/6)

    > The view part does not matter, propromo can only fetch the milestones and issues, not the views.
    > (version `2022-11-28` (latest) of the github-rest-api does not support that).

    ## 3. Visit create-monitor

    Visit [create-monitor](https://propromo.duckdns.org/create-monitor) and paste the url and the token in the input fields.
