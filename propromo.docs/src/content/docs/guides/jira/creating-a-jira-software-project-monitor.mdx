import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. Create a new jira api token

   <div style="position: relative; padding-top: 85%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
     <iframe
       src="https://scribehow.com/embed/Creating_an_Atlassian_personal_access_token__mxLVPs4XTXmgZKomZhKFEw"
       style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
       allowfullscreen
       frameborder="0"
     ></iframe>
   </div>

2. Copy a project url from `https://<your-organization-name>.atlassian.net/jira/your-work`.

3. Visit [create-monitor](https://propromo.duckdns.org/create-monitor) and select a project.

4. Copy the URL, that you are redirected to.  
   The path should look like this: `/jira/software/projects/<your-project-name>/boards/1`.  
   And paste it in the input fields together with your generated token.  
   _(The board number doesn't matter)_

</Steps>
